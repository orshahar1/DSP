## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
- MATLAB R2020a or later.
- Signal Processing Toolbox (optional for advanced visualization).

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/12danielLL/DSP_Project
2. Load the required .mat files into MATLAB
3. Run the scripts in the following order:
- `DSP_part1.m`: This script implements FFT and IFFT algorithms. It compares the custom implementation against MATLAB's built-in functions for verification.
- `DSP_part2.m`: This script contains the design and conversion of filters, as well as signal filtering using convolution and the OVA method.


  ## Results and Analysis

- *Custom FFT vs Built-in FFT*: The custom implementation closely matches MATLAB's built-in functions in both time and frequency domains.

- *Filter Responses*:
  - Analog and digital filters designed as per specifications.
  - Visualized magnitude response of Butterworth filters in both analog and digital domains.

- *OVA vs Direct Convolution*:
  - OVA significantly reduces computational time for large signals.
  - Comparison of execution times shows the efficiency of the OVA method over direct convolution for large inputs.
